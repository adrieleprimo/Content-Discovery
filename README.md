# What is Content Discovery?
Basically, it's the act of searching for and finding web content. Therefore, based on this principle, we have three content discovery methods: Manually, Automated and OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence).

## Manually 
Manually are manual searches that we can check from a website. Here we'll look at some ways of searching.

### **Robots.txt**
This is a file designed to tell you which urls on a site can be accessed.With this file we can gain access to various locations that they don't want us to access or discover.

**Example** -> https://target.com/robots.txt
